# Hand-Tracking
Double Hand Tracking Software for generic purpose. 

In the Exergaming game, the OPENCV library, which is included in the Python programming language, is used as CV2 and hand detection modules to detect 21 points and 21 joint connections of each hand by the Webcam. 

The hand position data obtained from Webcam is transferred to the Unity game engine thanks to socket programming. The interaction between hands with the objects is provided. Exergaming scenarios have been developed with the programming of these interactions.

***Note:*** This repository is essential for Hand Recognition for Exergaming Project.
